Theology: If Peter went fishing to pay taxes honestly owed, the opposite image shows the pope fishing for wealth. This language critiquing church wealth appeared already in Luther’s 95 Theses: “Therefore the treasures of the gospel are nets with which one formerly fished for men of wealth. The treasures of indulgences are nets with which one now fishes for the wealth of men” (LW 31:31; theses 65-66). Surrounded by other clergy, the pope pulls a net of coins up from under the lay people assembled below him. A money bag is at his feet. 

On the lower level, the lay people are being approached by a monk, nun, and priests, who have similarly gathered to collect money from the people. The text below the image cites a church law requiring the laity to pay what the clergy demand. Such financial burdens imposed by the church contributed to the common people’s dissatisfaction with the institutional church and the popularity of calls for reform.
