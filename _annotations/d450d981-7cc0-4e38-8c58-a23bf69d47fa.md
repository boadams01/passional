Theology: The work concludes by acknowledging the dramatic nature of these images. Is a book like this a crude exercise in libel, public ridicule, and defamation? The producers of this work admit that such an interpretation would be valid, if not for the many visible abuses in the papal church and clear statements to the contrary from scripture. At stake was not just a power struggle within the church or a fight over preferences and practices but the very soul of the church and its people. The final couplet invites not despair or cynicism, concluding with the words, “It will soon get better.”
