Theology: Referring to a papal decree about the office of bishop, the opposite panel shows and tells the common practice of bishops being too busy to preach. The text makes allowance for bishops and other clergy to spend their time in administrative affairs. Even more dramatically, the image depicts the pope, bishops and monks at a feast, surrounded by servants and musicians. Once again, this demonstrates the longstanding, common critique of decadence in the church and its leaders. The text ends with a poem about clerical excess and a reference to Isaiah 56, in which the prophet chides neglectful leaders:

All you beasts of the field, come to devour—
    all you beasts in the forest.
His watchmen are blind;
    they are all without knowledge;
they are all silent dogs;
    they cannot bark,
dreaming, lying down,
    loving to slumber.
The dogs have a mighty appetite;
    they never have enough.
But they are shepherds who have no understanding;
    they have all turned to their own way,
    each to his own gain, one and all.
“Come,” they say, “let me get wine;
    let us fill ourselves with strong drink;
and tomorrow will be like this day,
    great beyond measure.
