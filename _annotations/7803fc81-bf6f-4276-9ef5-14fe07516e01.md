Theology: 2 Thessalonians 2—another important early Protestant passage connecting the papacy with Antichrist—is cited below the picture of indulgence selling. Speaking of the coming day of the Lord, that Pauline letter says, “Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.” For the reformers, the papal claims of absolute supremacy and the rampant abuse involved in religious practices like the selling of indulgences was a clear sign that an enemy of Christ’s church had arisen from within the church itself, especially when contrasted with the radical critique of religious wealth visible in stories like Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple.
